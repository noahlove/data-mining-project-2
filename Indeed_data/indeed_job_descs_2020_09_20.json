Without access affordable financial products, they resort to predatory products like payday loans, high-interest rate credit cards, and overdraft fees to make ends meet. After the short-term relief, these predatory products ultimately push people further into deeper cycles of debt.\n\nPinwheel is building a fairer financial system by unlocking API access to payroll systems. Most people's money can be traced back to a payroll system (e.g. ADP, Paychex, Gusto, etc). This makes payroll systems incredibly powerful because they 1) harbor valuable income and employment data and 2) sit at the top of the financial stack, with the controls that determine where your paycheck goes and how it gets split up before anyone else has a say.\n\nUnfortunately, the payroll ecosystem is largely closed and highly fragmented, disconnected from the banks, lenders, and service providers that could benefit from access to it. By building the pipes that aggregate and unlock these payroll systems, Pinwheel helps consumers access better, cheaper financial products when they need them most while also sparking innovation of new financial products.\n\nWe're backed by First Round Capital, Upfront Ventures, and other top-tier investors and angels.

Our Design Researchers lead clients and teams through a journey of human-centered research to discover insights and inspiration and contribute to all phases of the design process. We\u2019re seeking an individual who is naturally empathetic and passionate about people. Design Researchers bring to life the voice of the people they\u2019re designing for, connecting the internal design team and client organization to the human experience. With society and technology continuing to evolve at a breakneck speed, IDEO needs a Design Researcher to help us strengthen our digital fluency (through both using digital tools for research as well as doing research in the context of designing digital platforms and products) - to push the edges of how we search for insights and inspiration for both internal and client initiatives.\n\nRelevant experience - what are we looking for?\n\nThe basics:\nA minimum of 3 to 6 years of qualitative research experience culminating in a sound ability to scope a research process, lead fieldwork, conduct interviews and perform desk research. Design Researchers must be prepared to plan and lead fieldwork to discover insights first-hand. Candidates need a strong foundation in qualitative methods and contextual inquiry that has been further developed through the integration of digital methods.\nAbility to synthesize research findings and to uncover and articulate insights that will inform and inspire design. Design Researchers must be able to lead the team (and often the client) through the analysis and synthesis processes \u2013 distilling down to focus on the most important insights, linking them together in frameworks or principles for design.\nAbility to shape and lead strategic, systems thinking based upon insights gathered through research. Experience working within a variety of industries and/or background in organizational/business/brand/systems design is a plus.\nExceptional communication and storytelling skills; fluency and confidence in inspiring teammates and clients with user-driven rationale.\nAbility to work flexibly and efficiently, exercising a balance between research rigor and inspiration.

Fluency in trend reporting is a plus.\nCuriosity to experiment with new approaches to inspire teams and gather insights along the journey of a product, to discover the methods that best address the specific questions at hand.\nA strong network in the creative and research community.\nA passion for improving people's life through design.\n\n\nOnce you\u2019re here, you\u2019ll\u2026\nJoin a dynamic team of design researchers whose work is a key differentiator for IDEO in the design consulting world.\nWork on projects within a multidisciplinary team often made up of designers, engineers, brand and business strategists, etc.\nBe responsible for structuring human-centered research and leading the internal and client teams through fieldwork, analysis of findings and insight development.\nConnect insights to design and collaborate with teammates to create innovative products, services, spaces, interactions and experiences.\nExperience the process of great ideas emerging from a deep understanding of people, business and technology.\nTravel to diverse regions inside or outside the U.S. to explore diverse human behavior and lifestyles.\n\n\nSome previous projects to check out:\nPingMD 2.0: PINGMD is a New York-based startup that offers a safe, easy way for healthcare providers, their colleagues, and their patients to communicate and collaborate via smartphone. The first version of PINGMD, which launched a few years ago, was based on the idea that many of these concerns could be addressed through quick, secure messages (text with photos or videos). IDEO collaborated with PINGMD to optimize the app\u2019s user interface, build new capabilities, and make the startup\u2019s website work better on mobile devices.\nSociety of Grownups for MassMutual: MassMutual partnered with IDEO over a two-year engagement to design a service that might impart the wisdom of thinking long-term to those who don\u2019t. Together we created a sort of master\u2019s program for adulthood, where the curriculum covers everything from investing in a 401K to having that hard talk about a budget to how to pick good, cheap wine. IDEO helped build the new venture from the ground up\u2014designing a brand identity, a digital platform with some of the most sophisticated financial planning tools in the industry, and a hip brick-and-mortar locale. Why \u201cSociety of Grownups?\u201d Because we\u2019re all here to help each other become a little smarter. And a little more grown-up.\nThe Royal Academy of Arts: As the Royal Academy of Arts approached its 250th anniversary, the institution came to IDEO to help create a digital strategy that would open new doors to its resources, reveal hidden avenues to new experiences, and offer broad vistas of its collection. The result is a website where an artist can learn more about RA schools; where the public can see a photo of the tidal creek that inspires painter Mali Morris; and the RA\u2019s Collections Team can tell an unexpected story about David Hockney\u2019s painting of the Grand Canyon. Organized around human needs rather than organizational structure, this new digital space allowed audiences to wander more freely in this immense storehouse of inspiration and awe.

Chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, Snowplow) and normalized, transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce and subscription datasets).\nAdditional comments\n\nThere are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.\n\nAs a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is an asset.

How do they diagnose a cluster, deployment, or service that\u2019s misbehaving?Architect cloud-native dev features that we haven\u2019t even thought of yet.
