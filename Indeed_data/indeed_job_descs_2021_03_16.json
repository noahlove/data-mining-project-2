It’s that ability to pair big-picture, award-winning thinking with a roll-up-our-sleeves mentality that allows Summer Friday to thrive as a content studio, digital conversion driver, omnichannel optimizer, and execution powerhouse for major fortune 500 brands.\nOUR CULTURE:\nTwo words define the Summer Friday state of mind: Fun and Fearless. We trust our people and processes, and that trust empowers us to be bold—to seek out projects that challenge us to grow and to constantly examine how our work impacts society. We balance that fearless spirit with a playfulness that shapes everything we do, from the way we share ideas to the way we collaborate and create. For us, it’s not about “work hard, play hard”, it’s about loving what you do and bringing that authentic passion to the team every day.\nOUR STANCE:\nManaging a creative marketing firm has always required an unwavering commitment to talent acquisition and advancement. We stand by the word of Martin Luther King Jr. when it comes to judging people by the content of their character and not the color of their skin. We take this further in recognizing all walks of life beyond skin, religion, and sex. Through this collective understanding and appreciation, we have learned that diversity is exactly what allows us to be successful, fun, smart, efficient, creative, innovative, and every day inspired. By continuing to place this emphasis, we believe that we are fighting racism and inequality from within. Charging ahead, we are committed to adapting policies as we learn and progress as a company and a country.",

Our small business is located in Manhattan, NY. We are biased — but we are pretty sure we are the coolest place to work for, ever. And we really believe that we are changing the world (you will see what we mean when you check out our website!). Honestly, the job is not all roses and puppy dogs — there is some good news and there is some bad news.Let’s get the bad news out of the way first:You won’t get rich at this job. The annual salary offered is $50,000 - $80,000. It can be some extra spending money, for sure. However, if you are seeking a job to support lots of people, then this is no longer the ”coolest” full time managing job ever.You will be working at 6 days of the week, with an optional day off, if desired.You will not receive any benefits, except for pay, of courseNow let’s talk about the good stuff:1. Our store is a beautiful state of the art shop. Okay, so that part is maybe not the greatest part that’ll pull you to this job, but there are some (truly) great things...2. The work is fun, fresh and dynamic. You will be working with our amazing staff and accomplishing you’re your daily tasks through teamwork, assisting all customers and orders.3. We aren’t big on stress. So, while we will expect you to work efficiently and get things done, we focus on open communication and getting things done right the first go around.4. We will work with your schedule to get a routine that works for you. Although Sundays and Fridays are important work days, we understand that 6 days straight can be a lot and therefore, we offer a weekly ‘day off’. Cool? Yes, we can do that too.5. You will experience things, do things, and make decisions on things that no big stuffy company would ever allow you to do.Now, let’s talk about the job requirements:1. You need to be the type person who gets joy out of getting things done. Every day, you will bang out a list of stuff. Fun stuff. Important stuff. Necessary stuff.2. You will be on the computer a lot. So, an understanding of email, navigating the web, and other computer-based stuff will be necessary.3. You will be on the phone too. So, you need to enjoying talking with people and giving/getting direction.4. You will be verifying insurance and filling orders accordingly, while giving customers accurate information, in a professional manner5. You need to be a person who loves to deliver remarkable experiences to other people. You know, you need to be someone who feels good by making other people feel good.6. You need to nail down the details. You don’t need to race through work and get things done half-assed (we figured that one out ourselves). We need you to slow things down and get them done right.7. We want you to be meticulous in your work. If you are shy or quiet (which actually sounds perfect for us) that is totally cool. We are not looking for the life of the party…in fact, quite the opposite. We are looking for a good, fun person, who actually gets work done.8. Our store can get busy, so multi-tasking abilities are pretty much a must in order to handle the days work loadIn short, your job is to help us in any way you can. And to have fun at work (who wants a job that isn’t fun?!?). Our office is casual, but we do expect professionalism and punctuality.But what we don’t expect is existing skills for you to qualify for this job. We can teach you that. We expect intelligence, energy, perfection and a get it done attitude.

We serve everyone from recently funded startups bringing their dream to life to large institutions needing innovative solutions to longstanding problems. We have been deploying products and honing our processes for over a decade and are leaders in the field of implementing sophisticated applications to a wide variety of platforms—from mobile to the cloud and everything in-between.Unlike giant faceless firms or status quo maintainers, Obsidian Systems offers a fresh perspective on process, a delightfully eager approach to learning the client's domain, and a technology stack that has proven to be highly effective. Our technology choices and commitment to repeatable processes make the software we design and deploy easier to maintain and extend, cheaper to own, and most importantly, more adaptable to change.We're based in New York but we're a distributed, remote-friendly workplace.About the role: Product Managers at Obsidian play a vital role both in our client relationships and our internal management. PMs dive deeply into client domains to ensure that we have stakeholder-level understanding of the software we're going to build. A typical deep-dive involves an understanding of the client's: product idea, business requirements, timeline, stakeholders, competitive landscape, designs, and user profiles. The aim is not just to transcribe what the client wants, but to collaborate with them in designing a product that's true to their vision and within their constraints.PMs are responsible for conveying this evolving product to our internal design and engineering teams so that detailed technical planning can take place and, ultimately, so that we can execute on the vision. As we iterate on the software, PMs take results back to the client and iterate on the vision: the two are interdependent.A process, like a piece of software, is never finished. You can always find ways to improve it, to resolve bugs, to get that extra bit of efficiency. We take pride in the processes we've developed over time, but we're always looking for further improvements. As a PM at Obsidian, you'd play an important role in shaping the future of our process organization-wide.About you: Given the breadth of industries, technologies, and clients we work with, we highly value intellectual curiosity, clear thinking, and constant questioning.

Yet the top policy research groups and think tanks driving new policy ideas lack technical expertise on staff or within their networks. Solving these challenges requires technical insight, which can uniquely be produced by exceptional technical talent.\n\nWe are seeking “Computer Science + policy” researchers to help build a next-generation technical strategy group from the ground up to solve this by producing cutting edge knowledge products on tech strategy questions to drive decision making for policymakers and philanthropic investment.\n\nThis is a one-year position based in New York, NY with full-time salary and benefits. Researchers will be based in the Schmidt Futures offices in New York and be able to travel within the U.S. and internationally on a regular basis as needed.\n\nAs a Plaintext Researcher, you will:\n\nProduce cutting edge research: Work with customers (i.e. decision makers in policy and philanthropy) to identify the most important topics for strategic analysis. Write the analysis itself with actionable outcomes in mind (e.g. policy proposals / grants / investments). Topics might include: tech competition with China, AI infrastructure, tech standards, algorithmic fairness.\nInfluence key decision makers and investments: We see direct impact through our grantmaking and extended network.\nWork with the best people: Within both Schmidt Futures and our broader network we work with leading experts at the intersection of tech and policy. Leverage the broader network to build working groups of subject matter experts, run the working groups.\n\nKnowledge, Skills and Abilities:\n\nStrong technical literacy: Candidates must be fluent with a variety of computing topics. The role will not involve coding, so detailed knowledge at the implementation-level is not necessary, but researchers will need to “know what they don’t know” and who to ask about it. Comfort with data analysis is a plus. The technical expertise required is analogous to a product manager.\nStrategic acumen: The ability to synthesize large amounts of raw information into actionable insights.\nExceptional written and spoken communication ability: Writing samples will be required in the application process.\nComfort in ambiguous unstructured environments: We are building a new form of organization. The environment is highly dynamic, and there are no precedents. Doing anything new comes with significant ambiguity and we want people that are excited by that environment and can thrive in it.\nProject management: experience turning ambiguity into concrete tasks and delegating that out.\nExperience applying metrics and objective-driven approach to solving problems: Comfort measuring outcomes, using OKRs etc.\nExperience or strong interest working at the intersection of technology and the public interest sector.\nEntrepreneurial mindset: Experience building something from the ground up (e.g. a club, a new team at their job, an event).\n\nRequirements\n\nReceived a computer science degree or related technical degree at an accredited university.\nDemonstrated interest or experience in projects at the intersection of technology and the social sector.\n\nWho We Are\n\nSchmidt Futures is a philanthropic initiative, founded by Eric and Wendy Schmidt, that finds exceptional people and helps them do more for others together. We knit talent into networks, bet on the most promising ideas through diverse forms of competition and support, and equip people to scale through partners and modern tools. To realize this vision, Schmidt Futures uses a broad set of tools — including gifts, grants, investments, and startup activity — for charitable, educational, and commercial efforts with a public purpose. Our initiative brings together the efforts of various charitable and non-charitable entities to improve our potential impact by making diverse types of capital available to the efforts we support.",

The American child welfare system has a history of disproportionately impacting families of color, low-income communities, and LGBTQ youth. As an organization that seeks to make child welfare systems more responsive to clients and more effective in its services and operations, our staff must reflect diverse backgrounds, experiences, and cultures.\nOur approach reflects our core values.\nEmpathy – We do this work to improve outcomes for children and families. We do not forget that the data we analyze reflects real humans with real experiences. We recognize that involvement with the child welfare system has deep, lasting, and often traumatic consequences for children, parents, and those who work in child welfare. We bear in mind that no action or decision occurs in a vacuum, rather within a historical and social context marked by disproportionality and scarcity.\nHumility – Working to improve systems is hard, takes longer than anyone wants, and is often humbling. We admit when we make mistakes, or when our efforts fail. We expect the same from those with whom we work. We do not seek to make a name for ourselves; there is no room for ego in our work.\nBelief in People – We invest in people because we believe in them and in their vision. We also believe our partners know best what they need to do to meet their goals. Our effectiveness as researchers and advisors rests on their informed judgment and ability to execute. We also believe in each other.\nPragmatism – We accept the limitations of what we can achieve, given the extent of our resources. We strive to set realistic goals for our partners and ourselves.

We seek to understand the context, history, strengths, and challenges of particular approaches,\n\ncomplementing statistical quantitative techniques with focus groups, interviews, and on-the-ground work\n\nto assess program operations.\nIn addition to rigorous designs and multiple research methods, we tap into sources of knowledge that are often\n\noverlooked. We have developed expertise in analyzing administrative data, an under-utilized resource that often\n\nproduces findings unobtainable elsewhere. We pair the results of data analysis with the perspectives of clients,\n\nfront line workers, middle managers, executives, and external stakeholders to form a comprehensive picture of\n\nhow policies and programs are experienced.\nWe are committed to creating strong relationships with our partners.

We help advertisers reach Amazon customers on Amazon.com, on other high quality sites across the web, and on millions of devices (Kindles, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Alexa, mobile, Twitch, and more). We start with the customer and work backwards in everything we do, including advertising. If you’re interested in joining a rapidly growing team working to build a unique, highly respected advertising group with a relentless focus on the customer, you’ve come to the right place.\n\nWhat is a Demand Side Platform (DSP)?\n\nA DSP is a web-based order management system for programmatic ad campaigns. Advertisers create and execute campaigns by entering when to run a campaign, setting targeting criteria to find the right audience, setting bid prices, selecting whether to optimize for clicks, sales, or other metrics, and more. Advertisers interact directly through our website or programmatic APIs. Customers can update campaigns one at a time or in bulk to scale across thousands of campaigns.\n\nWhat does DSP Core Tech, the hiring team, do?\n\nThe DSP Core Tech team is one of three teams within the Campaign Management organization. DSP Core Tech seeks to reduce the time it takes for application development teams to deliver well-tested, scalable, and highly performant software. The Core team also provides automated mechanisms that act as the gatekeeper of our production environment preventing components that do not meet our quality and latency bar from deploying. The Core team is an infrastructure team that partners closely with app dev teams to deliver features to our advertising customers. We write code that directly impacts the advertiser experience. We also create architectural patterns and select frameworks for both front end and server side components that are put into practice by the DSP Core Tech team and the multiple app dev teams with whom we work.\n\nWhat does the technical stack look like?\n\nOur browser-based advertising portal is built with a combination of ReactJS, Javascript, Web Components, Java and REST running on AWS using EC2, DynamoDB, S3, Elastic Search and other AWS services.\n\nIf I were hired, what would I be working on?\n\nOur 2021 goals include reducing page load times for order blotter views to be best in class, determining how to best leverage ‘Native AWS’ as we migrate our services to it, reducing time to deploy from 5 days to <= 1 day, increasing order management throughput to 5x scale, and more. You will partner with other developers on the team to design solutions and write code to achieve our goals.\n\nWhy should I join your team?\n\nBe a part of a team that is investing heavily in improving customer experience and infrastructure in a growing business. Work on major changes to campaign management components, not just tweaks. Work together with a data-driven team spanning technical leadership, UX, and development to delight customers. You will get to build out functionality using modern web tools and libraries. Solve interesting scale problems as we increase our customer base and grow volume 5x.

For our tool to be maximally expressive, it needs to establish a seamless feedback loop between its users and the machine learning models powering its abilities. It’s not sufficient for our models to be accurate; nor is it enough for our user interface to be beautiful and responsive; we need to ensure that the link between the two is as fast and reliable as possible.\nFor this reason, we’re looking for a Machine Learning Engineer who can help us create the server-side engine that powers our interactive tools for image and video synthesis. You’ll be working closely with our research and frontend teams to design and build low-latency, high-reliability machine learning deployments.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning will not just bring automation at every scale, but a significant change in how we create. That's why Runway is reimagining how we create, so we can create new things.\n\nRunway has an active and growing community of artists and creators all over the world. IBM, Google, R/GA, New Balance, Chanel, and dozen of companies are using Runway to create and explore new creative boundaries. Runway is also used to teach at a wide variety of institutions. From architectural programs at MIT to self-organized independent workshops in Perú.\nWe are a young company and this role is a unique opportunity to join a market-defining company in its early stages.\nRequirements:\nSolid knowledge of at least one machine learning research framework (e.g. PyTorch, Tensorflow), and at least one high-performance inference framework (e.g. TensorRT, Apache TVM).\nExperience profiling and optimizing deep neural networks, including knowledge of GPU profiling tools such as NVIDIA Nsight.\nFamiliarity with Python-based image and video manipulation/encoding/decoding frameworks, such as OpenCV and PyAV.\nExperience with cloud orchestration systems such as Kubernetes and cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, and Azure.\nOpinionated about writing robust and maintainable client-server architectures and APIs.\nAbility to rapidly prototype solutions and iterate on them with tight product deadlines.\nStrong communication, collaboration, and documentation skills.",

While these failures are not new, they have been exposed and exacerbated by the colliding damage caused by COVID-19, state violence and killing of Black people and the economic recession. The frame of economic democracy says that in order to address these failures we need to think beyond immediate economic relief and market-based solutions.

The past two decades have seen important progress on child rights, yet while much has been achieved, sharp disparities remain. In most countries, inequality is higher today than a generation ago, including in middle income countries where most of the world’s poor children now live. The rapid pace of urbanization and the growing youth bulge in Africa and parts of Asia will require significant expansion of the provision of essential services for children. These challenges are compounded by the scale and complexity of crises triggered by conflict, natural disasters or epidemics.

Located in the geographic heart of New York State, with a global footprint, and nearly 150 years of history, Syracuse University offers a quintessential college experience.\n\nThe scope of Syracuse University is a testament to its strengths: a pioneering history dating back to 1870; a choice of more than 200 majors and 100 minors offered through 13 schools and colleges; nearly 15,000 undergraduates and 5,000 graduate students; more than a quarter of a million alumni in 160 countries; and a student population from all 50 U.S. states and 123 countries.

The metro-area population totals approximately 500,000. The area offers a low cost of living and provides many social, cultural, and recreational options, including parks, museums, festivals, professional regional theater, and premier shopping venues. Syracuse and Central New York present a wide range of seasonal recreation and attractions ranging from water skiing and snow skiing, hiking in the Adirondacks, touring the historic sites, visiting wineries along the Finger Lakes, and biking on trails along the Erie Canal.\n\nEEOC\nSyracuse University is an equal-opportunity, affirmative-action institution. The University prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, color, creed, religion, sex, gender, national origin, citizenship, ethnicity, marital status, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity and gender expression, veteran status, or any other status protected by applicable law to the extent prohibited by law. This nondiscrimination policy covers admissions, employment, and access to and treatment in University programs, services, and activities.\n\nCommitment to Supporting and Hiring Veterans\nSyracuse University has a long history of engaging veterans and the military-connected community through its educational programs, community outreach, and employment programs. After World War II, Syracuse University welcomed more than 10,000 returning veterans to our campus, and those veterans literally transformed Syracuse University into the national research institution it is today. The University’s contemporary commitment to veterans builds on this historical legacy, and extends to both class-leading initiatives focused on making an SU degree accessible and affordable to the post-9/11 generation of veterans, and also programs designed to position Syracuse University as the employer of choice for military veterans, members of the Guard and Reserve, and military family members.\n\nCommitment to a Diverse and Inclusive Campus Community\nSyracuse University maintains an inclusive learning environment in which students, faculty, administrators, staff, curriculum, social activities, governance, and all other aspects of campus life reflect a diverse, multi-cultural, and international worldview. The University community recognizes and values the many similarities and differences among individuals and groups. At Syracuse, we are committed to preparing students to understand, live among, appreciate, and work in an inherently diverse country and world made up of people with different ethnic and racial backgrounds, military backgrounds, religious beliefs, socio-economic status, cultural traditions, abilities, sexual orientations and gender identities. To do so, we commit ourselves to promoting a community that celebrates and models the principles of diversity and inclusivity.\n\nQuick Link https://www.sujobopps.com/postings/85666\n\nJob Posting Date 01/21/2021\n\nApplication Deadline\n\nOpen Until Filled Yes\n\nPriority Consideration 02/28/2021\n\nJob Category Faculty\n\nMessage to Applicants"
