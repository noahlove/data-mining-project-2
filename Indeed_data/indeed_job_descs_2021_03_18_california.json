Combining cognitive science and machine learning, Quizlet guides students through adaptive study activities to confidently reach their learning goals. We’re on track to become the undisputed leader in user-generated learning content and engagement, at the scale of YouTube.\nValued at $1 billion, Quizlet has raised over $60 million in venture capital from investors including Icon Ventures, Union Square Ventures, General Atlantic, Costanoa Ventures, Owl Ventures, and Altos Ventures.\nTo serve our global community of learners, our teams tackle lofty technical challenges and design for use cases across cultures and languages. We work hard, act like owners, and collaborate every chance we get.

Hands-on workshops will surround formal curriculum in information and data science, and extend AFOG's existing research, workshops, and public speaker series. Public lectures and lunch talks will grow students' understanding and connections to the field. Through AFOG Reflection and Critical Technical Practice Workshops, students will reflect on what it means to practice ethically and in the public interest, exploring issues of power, identity, and expertise, and their role as a professional, an employee, an expert, and a member of the public in relation to the public good, social justice and social change. You will also organize four PIT-UN related workshops and help support Cal NERDS to develop their STEMinist post-bootcamp programming, and support other activities as needed.

Are you eager to join a trust-based, globally-connected team, where your contributions will make a meaningful difference?\nCome and see why Fortune Magazine consistently ranks The Trade Desk among best small-medium sized workplaces globally.\nAbout the Role:\nOur Engineers are end-to-end owners.

You will have the opportunity, depending on your interests and aptitude, to work on large-scale distributed systems coordinating thousands of servers in cloud and physical data centers around the world, petabyte-scale data challenges, machine learning, advanced visualizations, and interactive user interfaces – to name a few.\nWho We Are Looking For:\nYou have a sustained track record of making significant, self-directed, and end-to-end contributions to large and impactful software projects.

Our consideration is not limited by the kind of education you have or the specific technologies you have experience with.

We really care about personal growth (ex: the whole engineering team worked through Pieter Abbeel's CS294 last year, including all the homeworks, and some of us also completed CS287 and CS285).\nSalary: 130K - 170K\nEquity: 0 - .5%\nWe're looking for someone who is excited about the chance to build infrastructure for other deep learning researchers (ex: experiment tracking tools, model debugging methods, automated hyperparameter optimzers, developer tooling, etc).\nBenefits\nGain real exposure to deep learning research. Unlike \"machine learning\" roles at most companies, this role is 100% focused on supporting deep learning research (not just productionizing someone else's system).\nTake time to develop a deep understanding of what makes neural networks actually work by reading papers and the underlying code. Ex: we have a weekly paper club where we each present a paper we've read recently and answer everyone's questions about it.\nBe a part of a tight-knit team of great machine learning engineers / researchers. We all worked together at a previous startup, and have continued working together for years now because we love the culture we've built!\nCollaborate closely, even while remote. We've put an enormous amount of thought and effort into building an amazing remote-first culture. Ex: we spend at least half of our days pair programming, and we're all in Gather.town every day so that it's really easy to have quick, informal conversations.\nWork with other great programmers who care about their craft. Ex: even our machine learning code has tests (though we're not dogmatic—they're only tested to the extent that tests are useful). We have deterministic formatting, zero linter errors, wide type coverage with MyPy, etc.\nQualifications\nAre you empathetic, driven, and intellectually curious?\nDo you enjoy collaborating with other developers? Are you passionate about building tools for other programmers?\nAre you a great software engineer? We're flexible on the exact number of years of experience, but this likely is not a great fit for those with fewer than 3 years of post-college work experience (or the equivalent—we love people who are self-taught).\nAre you very comfortable writing Python?\nDo you really care about making a great research culture that feels welcoming and helps people feel safe exploring new ideas and asking important questions? Our goal is to build the best research culture in the world, and everyone is expected to actively contribute to that. We love exploring new ways to collaborate more effectively, whether it's using new tools for thought to organize information, or just something simple like new conversational habits and norms.\nExample tasks\nCreate world-class deep learning research infrastructure and tooling. Ex: we made a simple hyperparameter optimizer that allows us to tune models without spending any brain cycles or tons of compute. We love tools that free us up to work at a higher level.\nBuild new features that make experimentation easier. Ex: automated checks for vanishing or exploding gradients and other obvious problems.\nOpen source the best parts of our internal tooling and maintain our existing repositories. Ex: Jupyter Ascending, a tool we made that allows you to easily write code in a real editor, like vim or emacs, and instantly sync that into a Jupyter notebook, giving sort of the best of both worlds. Fixing bugs and resolving issues for the broader software community is important to us.\nContribute patches to fix bugs in other open source repositories.\nMake our experiment infrastructure more robust. Ex: better handling for machines being killed in a distributed setup, or enabling experiments to be run easily on multiple cloud providers or even a local machine, etc.\nAbout us\nGenerally Intelligent (https://generallyintelligent.ai/) is an early-stage AI research company. We're working directly on building human-level general machine intelligence that can learn naturally in the that way humans do. Our mission is to understand the fundamentals of learning and build safe, humane machine intelligence.\nWe're supported by investors that include Y Combinator, researchers from OpenAI, the founders of Dropbox, Lightspeed Venture Partners, and Threshold Ventures (formerly DFJ).",
